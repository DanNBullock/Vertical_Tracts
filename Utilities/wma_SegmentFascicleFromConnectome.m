function [fg, keepFG] = wma_SegmentFascicleFromConnectome(fg, rois, operation, fascicleFileName)
%
% Segment a fascicle from a connectome by applying a series of 'AND' and
% 'NOT' operations between the connectome and a set of ROIs.
%
% The important aspect of this function is that it returns both the new
% fiber group AND the indices in the origianl fiber group of the fibers
% that passed all the 'and' and 'not' operations requested.
%
% These idices can be used to address the columns of a LiFE model (M
% matrix). This allows for subtracting entire fiber group dfined
% anatomically from a pre-existing connectome. In turns this allows for
% testing hypotheses on the improtance of an (anatomically selected)
% fascicle within the volume of white-mater comprised by the connectome.
%
% [fg fibersIndices] = feSegmentFascicleFromConnectome(fg, rois, operation, fascicleFileName)
%
% INPUTS:
%   fg           - A connectome (e.g., fg = feGet(fe,'fibers acpc'))
%   rois         - A cell array of rois to be used for selecting the fibers in the
%                  final fascicle
%   operation    - A set of logical operations to be applied to the fibers in
%                 the connectome in relation to the rois. There should be one
%                 operation per roi. 
%   fascicleName - The name of the final fascicle. 
%
%
% OUTPUTS:
%  fg            - The segmented fiber group, containing only the fibers
%                  that passed all the logical operations.
%  keepFG        - A vector of indices (0's and 1's) of the length of the
%                  number of fibers in the input fiber group. A one
%                  indicates that the fiber survived all the logical
%                  operations requested. A 0 indicates that the fibers did
%                  not survive some of the logical operations and it was
%                  deleted from the output fiber group.
