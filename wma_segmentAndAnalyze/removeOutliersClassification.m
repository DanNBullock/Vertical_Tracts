%
% Performs outlier removal given input parameters. Defauts to 4 and 4 if
% nothing put in.
%
% INPUTS: 
%
% -classification: Either the path to structure or the structure itself.
%  The strucure has a field "names" with (N) names of the tracts classified
%  while the field "indexes" has a j long vector (where  j = the nubmer of
%  streamlines in wbFG (i.e. length(wbFG.fibers)).  This j long vector has
%  a 0 for to indicate a streamline has gone unclassified, or a number 1:N
%  indicatate that the streamline has been classified as a member of tract
%  (N).
%
% -wbFG: Either the path to the fe or WBFG, or the
%  structure itself
%
% -centroid SD: paramater for the sd deviance cut off from distance from
%  centroid of fibers.  Fibers outside of this distance will be pruned.
%
% -length SD: paramater for the sd deviance cut off for fiber length
%  fibers exceeding the threshold will be pruned.
%
% -selectPrune: a vector of indexes into the classification.names structure
%  indicating which tracts the user would like to have pruned
